            Pokemon TCG cards have a generic Pokemon logo print at the back, and
            a special design on the front. The front design - the design that
            defines the card - can consist of:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A Pokemon</li>
            <li>An energy card (basic or special)</li>
            <li>A trainer card (item, tool, supporter, stadium)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each card comes from a different series (Scarlet and Violet: Surging
            Sparks, Mega Evolution, Rivals Destination, etc.) The same kind of
            card can exist in every series. For instance, every series can have
            it's own Pikachu. However, the attacks and artstyle can change.

            Pokemon cards have been in production since 1996, and the companies
            behind them are the Pokemon Company and Game Freak. The cards are
            based on the iconic Pokemon games, where each game has an RPG-like,
            turn-based battle style, where you can catch Pokemon and use them in
            battle. You can make your Pokemon attack, use an item, or attempt to
            run (you can only run in a battle against a wild Pokemon). The
            objective is to be the only player with playable Pokemon left to
            win. The Trading Card Game is similar to this concept, except there
            are slightly different rules. For instance, one rule is that in
            order to win a game, you must claim six prize cards, knock out all
            your opponent's playable Pokemon, or cause your opponent's deck to
            run out of cards they can draw (more can be explained on the "how to
            play" page); whereas the basic way to win in the video games is to
            knock out all your opponents Pokemon.

            The exact rules of the game are unfamiliar to most people, since
            there are more collectors than players. The cards are intended for
            the game; however there is nothing wrong with just collecting them.
            In fact, within the recent years there are different and specially
            designed cards made to be more rare than others, and are intended
            for collection. Apart from being cosmetic in appearance, the rarer
            cards have gained actual value, and are worth real money. Some are
            worth only a few dollars; others can go for hundreds or even
            thousands. A "Moonbreon", or a VMax Umbreon alternate art (161/131)
            from Evolving Skies generally goes for about a thousand dollars.
