      <b>Water</b> Pokemon are a basic Pokemon type that a lot of people use and
      collect. They are popular in terms of playing the game, and for
      collecting. Some well-known and powerful cards consist of
      <b>Gyrados</b> and <b>Palkia</b>. Some other cards include:

        Some water cards are themed around <b>ice</b>. Although ice-types exist
        in standard Pokemon, they are water Pokemon instead in the TCG series to
        keep things simple. Some ice-type water Pokemon include
        <b>Glaceon</b> (regular, V, VMax, VStar) and <b>Abomasnow</b> (regular
        and Mega ex). These Pokemon have steel as their weakness, instead of the
        standard electric or grass. They still do water-type damage, as do all
        water Pokemon.

        Water Pokemon have a special attachable card that, if your Pokemon is
        knocked out in battle, will revive it by letting you put it back into
        your hand where you keep cards that you use.
