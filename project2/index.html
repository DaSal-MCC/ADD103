      It takes place during winter, a peaceful season.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It snows during the winter, and the snow glitters and shines both day and
      night. People can go outside to play in the snow, and build snowmen, make
      snow angels, and have snowball fights. If none of those things suit
      anyone, they can also stay home with their families and spend time
      together. A common indoor activity to do when it snows is to sit by the
      window and drink cocoa while watching the snow fall. Other activities
      include Christmas movies, setting up Christmas decorations, or making
      Christmas decorations.

      Peppermint mochas are also a fitting drink.

      People set up bright lights and decorations during Christmas.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The decorations are jolly and festive, consisting of Christmas trees,
      snowmen, and famous Christmas movie characters. Any one can style the
      decorations in anyway, resulting in a variety of decorated houses to look
      at. There are also bright string lights that people put up, and they can
      consist of multiple colors and shapes. They can be regular lights, bubble
      lights, or detailed lights of Christmas characters. They look the best at
      night, because they really show off and help you to focus on them more,
      along with the other bright decorations.

      There are presents, food, and tradition to go around.
    </h2>
    <p>
      During the Christmas season, families get to spend time together and bond,
      while enjoying activities and the actual morning of Christmas itself,
      where everyone opens their presents, eat luxury food, go to church, and
      visit relatives.
