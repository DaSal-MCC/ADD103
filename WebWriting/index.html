      <b>Fire</b> Pokemon are one of the most well-known kind of Pokemon card
      type you can obtain. There are common Fire Pokemon cards like the basic
      energy cards, the <b>Ninetales</b> evolution line and the
      <b>Infernape</b> evolution line, but then there are rarer and more
      powerful cards like <b>Charizard</b> (ex, GX, VMax, and VStar). Even more
      powerful cards include:

      <li>Gouging Fire ex</li>
      <li>Arcanine ex</li>
    </ul>

        There are a lot of fire-type cards that exist, but only some are used in
        the TCG game for their abilities, like <b>Entei ex</b>.
      </li>

        Most of the powerful cards usually consist of <b>Charizard</b>, in terms
        of his ex, GX, VMax and VStar versions (especially his VMax evolution,
        which has an attack that deals 300 damage). In terms of market value,
        he's also one of the most valuable cards.
