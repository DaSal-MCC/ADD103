      <p>
        The official origin of the Pumpkin Spice Latte isn’t known to many.
        According to The Daily Meal, Starbucks worker and director of espresso
        Peter Dukes was believed to be the inventor of the Pumpkin Spice Latte
        when it launched in 2003. However, he wasn’t the first to create
        pumpkin-coffee mixtures. The first instance of pumpkin-flavored drinks
        originates to the 1600s, based on an article titled, “A Description of
        the New Netherlands” by Adriaen van der Donck, which mentions unnamed
        people attempting to make beverages from pumpkins. In the 1930s,
        McCormick had already tried to make its first blend of pumpkin spice
        coffee, consisting of cloves, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. Soon after,
        they began mass-producing various spices in 1934, causing an uprising in
        pumpkin and pumpkin spice foods, like cupcakes, cake rolls, and other
        pastries and foods. Sometime in 1980, it was suggested in the Montreal
        Gazette to use pumpkin spice as a substitute for sugar. This set off an
        experimentation era of pumpkin spice and coffee, leading to Starbucks
        releasing its first-ever version of the Pumpkin Spice Latte in 2003.
        Ever since its release, Starbucks has made changes to its latte. There
        was controversy because it originally didn’t contain pumpkin; it had
        pumpkin spice sauce, which was artificial. However, the sauce recipe was
        changed to include pumpkin puree, along with water, sugar, and other
        spices, like cinnamon and nutmeg. The recipe has changed a lot since
        then, evolving into the latte it is today, and inspiring other people
        and coffee chains.
