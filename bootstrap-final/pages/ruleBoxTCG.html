            Certain cards have a special rule box associated with them. These
            cards also have a special logo to indicate they're a more powerful
            card (ex, EX, mega EX, Mega ex, V, VStar, VMax, break, GX, V-Union.)
            Only certain cards are allowed in the main play of the game, also
            refered to as "standard play." At the time of writing this, the only
            advanced card types allowed in standard play are "ex" and "Mega ex".
            Every other card is only allowed in an alternate form of play known
            as "extended play."
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              EX cards are one of the first special cards to exist. They are
              generally more powerful than other cards, and their special rule
              box is that your opponent takes two prize cards if it's defeated
              (see "how to play" for more information on prize cards.)
            </li>
            <li>
              ex cards are similar to EX cards, except they are noticably
              stronger though aspects like their HP, which is usually higher
              that 300. Their special rule box is, again, that your opponent
              takes two prize cards if it's defeated.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mega EX cards are mega-evolved Pokemon. They are usually stronger
              than EX pokemon and have powerful attacks. They evolve directly
              from EX cards, and evolving them immediately ends your turn. Their
              special rule box is that your opponent takes two prize cards if
              it's defeated.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mega ex cards are, again, mega-evolved Pokemon. They are very
              different, though, in that they can have just as good or even
              better stats than most other Pokemon; however, the drawback is
              that their rule box usually states that your opponent takes
              <i>three</i> prize cards if it's defeated.
            </li>
            <li>
              V cards are a special kind of Pokemon card. Any pokemon can evolve
              from V to either VStar or VMax, if either or both variants exist
              for them. For instance, a V Machamp can only evolve into a VMax
              Machamp, because there is no VStar version of MaChamp. However, V
              Charizard can evolve into both VStar and VMax Charizard, since
              both versions exist. Their special rule box is that your opponent
              takes two prize cards if it's defeated.
            </li>
            <li>
              VMax cards are very powerful cards, similar to ex cards. They're
              also similar to Mega ex cards in that their rule box also states
              that your opponent takes three prize cards if it's defeated.
            </li>
            <li>
              VStar cards are less strong than VMax cards. To make up for that,
              however, they have a special "V-Star Power." It can be either an
              attack or an ability. Once it's used, though, it can't be used
              again for the rest of a game, nor can you use other VStar powers.
              Their special rule box is that your opponent takes two prize cards
              if it's defeated.
            </li>
            <li>
              Break cards are a special evolution card. It's artwork shows a
              golden version of the evolved Pokemon, and the card is supposed to
              be sideways. When you use it to evolve a Pokemon, you put it on
              top of the card's artwork, and any attacks it has stacks with the
              original Pokemon's attacks. It has no special rule box.
            </li>
            <li>
              GX cards are similar to VStar cards in that they also have a GX
              power that can only be used once in a game. Their special rule box
              is that your opponent takes two prize cards if it's defeated.
            </li>
            <li>
              V-union cards are a more interesting but complicated version of a
              V card. There are four normal-sized cards that must be placed
              together to form one big card. There is an indicator to show that
              they're apart of the same card. To play them, they all must be
              placed in the discard pile. After that, they can be redrawn and
              played in battle. V-Union cards have multiple attacks and
              abilities, and have very high HP. Their special rule box is that
              your opponent takes three prize cards if it's defeated.
