            To play the actual game, you need to form a deck of 60 cards of your
            choice. You are only allowed to have up to four of the same card,
            unless stated otherwise within the card's rules (for example, you
            can only have one ACE SPEC card in your deck.) The only other
            exception is for basic energy cards, where you can have as many as
            you want. You need at least one basic Pokemon in your deck - basic
            cards are playable right away. Without any playable Pokemon, you
            can't play the game.

            <b>The diagram to the right</b> shows what your setup should look
            like, both yours and your opponents. Place your deck to the right.
            Leave space below your deck for a pile known as your discard pile.
            Draw 6 cards from your deck and place them to your left, face down.
            There are a few ways to arrange them, but one way is to spread them
            out in a 2x3 pattern. These are your prize cards. Draw 7 more cards
            from your deck into your hand, and place any basic Pokemon you find
            to your front, into your active spot. If there aren't any basic
            Pokemon in your hand, you'll have to do a <i>mulligan</i>, where you
            place those 7 cards back into your deck, shuffle your deck, and
            redraw seven cards, and keep repeating until you have at least one
            basic Pokemon drawn. If you have any extra basic Pokemon, you can
            place up to three of them below the Pokemon in the active spot, into
            an area called the benched spot. Keep your other cards in your hand.
            Once both players have a Pokemon in their active spot, the game can
            begin. Flip a coin, and call heads or tails. Whoever gets the call
            right, decides whether they can go first or if their opponent can go
            first. Whoever goes first, can't attack on their first turn.

          <h2>Playing the Game</h2>
          <p>
            On your turn, you must draw a card from your deck. After that, you
            can decide to attack, or skip your turn. Before then, you can attach
            an energy card to a Pokemon, use trainer cards, use a Pokemon's
            ability, or evolve a Pokemon.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When you attach an energy card, you can attach it to any Pokemon
              you like. You can only attach one energy card to one Pokemon every
              turn, unless you use a Pokemon's ability that lets you attach more
              than one energy card. Attaching energy is important, because when
              you attack, you must have the correct amount of energy attached to
              the Pokemon, as indicated by the energy markers to the left of
              it's attack name. The energy stays attached unless the attack
              states to discard any energy.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can use as many item and tool trainer cards as you like. When
              attaching tool cards, you can only attach one tool to each
              Pokemon, and it stays attached. You can only use supporter and
              stadium cards once per turn.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can only use a Pokemon's ability if it's in the active or
              benched spot. You can use multiple abilities, but each ability can
              only be used once.
            </li>
            <li>
              To evolve a Pokemon, you need the correct stage card. To evolve a
              basic card, place it's Stage 1 card on top of it (make sure it's
              the correct evolved Pokemon as indicated near the evolution marker
              at the top). To evolve a Stage 1 Pokemon, place the Stage 2 card
              on top of it. Sometimes, you can evolve a card into a special
              form, like it's ex form. The rules regarding evolution is that you
              can only evolve one Pokemon once per turn, and you can't evolve a
              Pokemon on your first turn.

          <h2>Attacking</h2>
          <p>
            When attacking, make sure you have the correct amount of energy
            attached, as explained above. Deal the amount of damage that is
            indicated on the attack, listed to the right of the attack's name.
            Put damage indicators - circular cardboard pieces with numbers on
            them - on top of your opponent's Pokemon, totaling the damage amount
            from the attack. Most Pokemon have weaknesses or resistances -
            indicated at the bottom of the card - that amplify the damage dealt.
            Add or remove extra damage indicators when applicable, although some
            attacks/abilities may change the damage dealt. The damage amount
            from the indicators is greater than the Pokemon's health, that
            Pokemon is knocked out. Place it in the discard pile.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you discard any cards, or have any Pokemon that run out of
            health, place them in your discard pile face-up. Your discard pile
            is below your deck. When you attack or skip your turn, your turn
            ends. Your opponent attacks next, and the game goes until someone
            wins.

          <ul style="margin-bottom: 20%">
            <li>
              Claim all your prize cards. To claim a prize card, you must knock
              out your opponent's Pokemon. Some Pokemon, when knocked out, have
              a special rule box that says your opponent can draw more than one
              prize card (usually two or three).
            </li>
            <li>
              Knock out all your opponent's playable Pokemon, or put them in a
              situation where they can't play any Pokemon. If your opponent
              can't play any more Pokemon, you win the game, regardless of how
              many prize cards you have.
            </li>
            <li>
              Empty your opponents deck (cause them to run out of cards they can
              draw). Each player must draw a card from their deck every turn,
              and if they can't, they lose.
