        Hi! I'm David, and this is my website. Here you'll get to view mostly
        everything about me, primairly some background information and my
        interests in Pokemon cards and Roblox studio coding. You can find the
        latter two in the links above, but this page contains all my background
        information. The image to the <b>right</b> is me. I'm attending MCC and
        aim to get a degree in software design and development, and my dream job
        is to be a video game developer. I've always loved video games growing
        up, and that has inspired me to make my own, where I can not only make
        money, but have fun doing it, too.
      </p>

        The image to the <b>left</b> is my workspace. When I do my college work
        or just relax, I do it here on my laptop, at my personal table. I have
        other items here, like candy, coffee, my headphones, and other things to
        display. I do my homework here, both for online and in-person classes,
        but when I'm not doing anything important, I like to play games on my
        laptop instead, or do other things like build lego sets, unbox Pokemon
        cards, or just sit down for a little while. I like to keep all my
        Rubik's Cubes and Pokemon cards here, because they're easy to access
        right away and they're on display for everyone to see.
