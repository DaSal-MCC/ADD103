        I very recently got into Pokemon card collecting as a hobby. I used to
        collect Pokemon cards a long time ago, but ended up forgetting about it.
        However, I recently got back into it out of boredom, and have collected
        many new cards ever since. It's frusterating though, because every
        possible store near me is always out of them, usually due to people
        scalping the cards and buying as many as they can, leaving almost
        nothing for anyone else. Even so, I've still managed to luck out with
        buying a few card packs now and then, but I can only get a few packs
        once every week or two due to the scalping situation. The binder on the
        <b>left</b> image contains all my cards; every card I collect is stored
        in it. There are still a ton of blank pages that I hope to fill. Sorting
        the cards is a pain, especially because I sort them in a specific,
        orderly way, and I have to remove specific cards from slots in order to
        be able to insert the new ones in, and then I have to put all the
        removed cards back in order. The image on the <b>right</b> contains
        stuff from a Pokemon pack that I got for Christmas a few years back. It
        was part of a Origin Forme Dialga VStar Premium collection box, and
        contained:

      <ul
        style="
          float: left;
          padding: 20px;
          margin: 30px;
          margin-top: 5px;
          width: 50%;
        "
      >
        <li>A VSTAR marker</li>
        <li>A coin</li>
        <li>Two special Dialga cards</li>
        <li>An oversize Dialga card</li>
        <li>Various card packs</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="float: left; padding: 20px; margin: 30px; margin-top: 5px">
        I left it unopened for years, then when I got interested in cards again,
        I finally decided to open it. This sparked my desire to keep buying card
        packs from stores and further expand my collection.
