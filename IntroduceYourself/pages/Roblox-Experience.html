        Part of where my coding journey started was with Roblox Studio. Its the
        coding application for Roblox, a popular gaming site that features
        multiple games in one service, each game being made by a different
        person, who uses Roblox Studio to code and publish their game. I started
        coding in Studio because I wanted to learn code and try to upload my own
        game. The <b>above</b> image is one of my first projects, where I
        combined everything I was learning to one game. I was hoping to make and
        release a game publicly on Roblox, but my interests are shifting, and
        I'm not as interested in making my career on Roblox as I used to be.
        However, I still intend to release a game, just on a different gaming
        platform, and Roblox is more like a training grounds for me.

        The <b>above</b> image is where you download Roblox. After installing
        it, you can create a new project, and from there, you can do whatever
        you want. You can code, you can build, you can create custom meshes in a
        3D modeling site like Blender and insert those into Studio, or you can
        do all of the above. I've done all these things in Studio, but I've had
        trouble with it before. It's not just getting what I want to look or
        work right, but it's also the flawed moderation system Roblox has that
        I've struggled with. I've uploaded things that were innocent and met the
        terms of service, but there have been several times where I was falsely
        flagged by the moderation system for something that was deemed
        "inappropriate" by the AI system. There was even a time were I was
        wrongly banned for 3 days from the Roblox platform for uploading action
        button images for my test world, and the AI thought it was inappropriate
        when it actually wasn't.
