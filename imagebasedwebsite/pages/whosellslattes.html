              There are a few cafes that sell Pumpkin Spice Lattes, along with
              various fall-themed treats:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li id="left">
                Starbucks is well-known for their version of the Pumpkin Spice
                Latte, along with variants of it like the iced version and the
                frappuchino version. They also sell other seasonal drinks like
                the Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew, which you can read about in the
                Other Seasonal drinks section.
              </li>
              <li id="left">
                Dunkin Donuts sells Pumpkin Spice Lattes. They generally release
                theirs before Starbucks does, and their version consists of
                several ingredients, including caramel.
              </li>
              <li id="left">
                McDonalds’ McCafe sells Pumpkin Spice Lattes, containing the
                standard ingredients like pumpkin and cinnamon flavor, along
                with steamed whole or nonfat milk. They also sell seasonal
                treats like the Baked Apple Pie and the Pumpkin and Creme Pie.
              </li>
              <li id="left">
                Dutch Bros sells Pumpkin Spice Lattes, made with a unique
                Pumpkin purlee. They sell lattes, along with other seasonal
                drinks, like the Caramel Pumpkin Brulee, one of their iconic
                drinks.
              </li>
              <li id="left">
                Peets sells what they call a Pumpkin Latte, which tastes similar
                to pumpkin pie.

                Starbucks sells Pumpkin Spice Latte coffee creamers in stores,
                which is based closely on their Pumpkin Spice Latte in their
                cafe. You can also find a non-dairy version of the creamer.
              </li>
              <li id="left">
                Chobani sells Pumpkin Spice creamer, along with an Oatmilk
                version of it.
              </li>
              <li id="left">
                Coffee mate sells Pumpkin Spice Creamer, which tastes like
                Pumpkin Pie, according to them.

                Some creamers have instructions online to make a more accurate
                version of the PSL. Starbucks does this, and you can use their
                creamer to make something like the above image!

                You may need steamed milk for a lot of the more accurate
                recipes, though. This is common in the offical drinks.
